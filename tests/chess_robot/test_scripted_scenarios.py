"""Scripted-game scenarios for CommentaryGateHook.

Drives the gate through full games turn-by-turn against a fake
environment, captures every analytics payload, directive, and gate
decision, and asserts that the outputs match what a reasonable user
reading the chat would see.

These scenarios exist to catch **real failure modes**, not to confirm
happy paths — each one is modelled after an actual bug we've hit or
one that's plausible given the code shape:

* Sign-flip across colour / player combinations (the
  ``09-32-22.png`` screenshot regression).
* Pronoun confusion in the user-facing chat bubble vs. the LLM
  directive.
* Silent-turn streak tracking across long quiet phases.
* Greeting exactly once per game.
* Correct classification attribution (whose move was the mistake).
* Rich move descriptions (piece names, captured piece, check / mate
  suffixes, castling, promotion) on realistic SAN sequences.

If a future change regresses one of these behaviours, the harness
will say which scenario, which turn, and what field is wrong.

    User played Ba6 — hanging the bishop. Rook replied Nxa6, free

    initiative.' — congratulating the user for losing a piece.

    Two fixes the directive must now carry:
      1. MATERIAL CHANGE line telling the model explicitly that Rook
         gained material and the user lost the exchange.
      2. MOOD CUE telling the model to sound confident (Rook is
         winning), NOT to generically congratulate the user.
      3. No "bold" in the example reactions — the model was
         literally copy-pasting the example.
