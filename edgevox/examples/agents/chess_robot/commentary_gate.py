"""CommentaryGateHook — decide when Rook should speak, based on real signals.

Pacing (current calibration):

* Opening (first 2 plies of the game, flagged by ``ctx.session.state
  ["greeted"]``): always speak.
* Game over / check / checkmate / any capture: speak.
* Inaccuracy, mistake, blunder classifications: speak.
* Otherwise: increment a ``quiet_streak`` counter; after three quiet
  turns in a row, speak a casual remark so Rook doesn't feel dead.

Tune ``_QUIET_STREAK_LIMIT`` if the chatter/silence ratio feels off —
lowering makes Rook more talkative, raising makes him quieter.

History:
* First pass gated too hard (mistakes / blunders / rook-or-queen
  captures only) and Rook went silent for entire games. Now biased
  toward speaking on any move that has *any* verifiable hook, with the
  anti-fabrication guard kept in the briefing itself.


Small instruction-tuned LLMs (1-2B) are unreliable at two things the
original prompt asked of them:

1. Staying silent on routine moves. They will emit filler every turn no
   matter how many "you don't have to speak" directives the system
   prompt contains.
2. Not fabricating tactical claims. Given a FEN + eval + top-line
   briefing, they'll cheerfully invent pins, forks, and attacks that
   don't exist on the board.

This hook addresses both deterministically — it inspects the
:class:`ChessEnvironment` snapshot after :class:`MoveInterceptHook` has
applied the user's move and the engine's reply, decides whether this
moment is noteworthy, and either:

* suppresses the turn entirely with ``HookResult.end("")`` — the LLM
  never runs, the chat stays quiet, the face still updates via
  :class:`RobotFaceHook`;
* or stashes a ``commentary_directive`` on ``ctx.session.state`` that
  :class:`RichChessAnalyticsHook` surfaces to the model as a
  ``GROUND TRUTH`` block. The model can only narrate what's in that
  block, which keeps commentary grounded in verified facts instead of
  hallucinated tactics.

Runs at priority 85 — after :class:`MoveInterceptHook` (90) applies the
moves, before the analytics briefing (75) injects into messages.
