"""Rich chess analytics as a hidden system message.

:class:`RichChessAnalyticsHook` fires at :data:`BEFORE_LLM`, builds a
compact but comprehensive "briefing card" from the current
:class:`ChessEnvironment` + engine analysis, and injects it as a
``role=system`` message into the messages list just before the last
user message.

Why a system message (vs. prepending to the user task):

1. **Clean user chat** — the React chat log shows exactly what the
   user typed; rich analytics stay out of the transcript.
2. **Fresh at every hop** — the hook re-runs each time the agent
   loops, so the briefing reflects the latest position (after any
   tool-induced mutations).
3. **Semantically correct** — context that is "about the game" isn't
   user speech; system role is the appropriate channel.

The briefing is written in PLAIN ENGLISH, not JSON. Small LMs (1-2 B)
handle natural prose markedly better than structured data, and our
chess content is short enough that parsing cost is zero.

The briefing makes PERSPECTIVE explicit — which colour is Rook, which
is the user — because small models routinely confuse whose move was
just played.
