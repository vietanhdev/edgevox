"""Reply sanitisation for Rook.

Three cleanups run at :data:`AFTER_LLM` before the reply reaches TTS:

- :class:`ThinkTagStripHook` — removes ``<think>...</think>`` blocks
  (and truncated ``<think>`` prefixes when the model ran out of tokens
  before closing the tag). Required for Qwen3-family models which
  default to reasoning mode — without stripping, the robot literally
  reads the model's internal monologue out loud.
- :class:`VoiceCleanupHook` — strips markdown artefacts (asterisks,
  backticks, leading list dashes) that TTS engines spell out.
- :class:`SentenceClipHook` — trims the reply to the first N sentences
  so the SLM can't run on past its point. Small models tend to repeat
  or template-loop when they overshoot; capping their output defends
  against that without changing generation parameters.

All hooks are idempotent and safe to stack — if nothing matches they
return ``None`` and the payload flows through unchanged.
