"""Barge-in / interruption controller for the voice agent pipeline.

The streaming pipeline (:class:`edgevox.core.pipeline.StreamingPipeline`)
should be able to detect sustained user speech while TTS is playing and
cut everything off — TTS audio, in-flight LLM generation, and, when
configured, the currently running skill. This module provides the
coordinator that other components attach to.

Two signals are exposed:

- ``interrupted`` — general "stop what you're doing" event. TTS, the
  agent loop, and skill dispatch poll or wait on this.
- ``cancel_token`` — dedicated event piped into
  ``llama_cpp.Llama``'s ``stopping_criteria`` so an in-flight LLM
  generation actually aborts rather than running until ``max_tokens``
  drains. The agent loop threads this into :meth:`LLM.complete`.

Wiring:

.. code-block:: python

    ic = InterruptController()
    ctx = AgentContext(interrupt=ic)

    # mic / VAD worker
    for frame in mic_stream():
        if vad.is_speech(frame) and tts_state.is_playing:
            ic.trigger(reason="user_barge_in")

    # TTS worker observes ic.interrupted and flushes the buffer
    # LLM worker receives ic.cancel_token via LLM.complete(stop_event=…)
    # Agent loop honors ctx.should_stop() between hops and between tokens

The controller itself is tiny and dependency-free — all the real work
happens in the subscribers. This is the Protocol that makes it
plug-and-play.

class InterruptPolicy:
    """Tunable thresholds for barge-in behavior.

    Defaults reflect typical robot voice UX:

    - 250 ms of sustained speech energy before trigger (eliminates
      false-positives on "uh", brief throat-clears).
    - LLM generation always cancelled on interrupt.
    - Skills **not** cancelled by default: interrupting a Panda mid-grasp
      because the user said "um" is worse than letting the grasp finish.
      Opt in per-agent when appropriate.

    **Echo mitigation** (when TTS audio leaks into the mic without AEC):

    - ``echo_suppression_ratio`` — when echo reference is available,
      mic energy must exceed ``ratio × echo_reference`` to count as
      user speech. Default 2.0 = "speak twice as loud as the bot".
    - ``echo_floor_window_ms`` — at the *start* of TTS playback (before
      the user could realistically have started barging in) we observe
      the mic energy as a calibration of the room's echo floor and use
      that as an additional threshold. 200 ms is enough for the AEC
      tail to settle without mistaking real early-barge-in for echo.
    - ``tts_release_ms`` — refractory period after TTS stops; the mic
      keeps picking up echo tail / room reverb for ~150-250 ms after
      the speaker goes silent. We ignore the mic during this window.

    To **wire echo mitigation** into your pipeline, pass
    ``tts_energy_provider=lambda: player.last_output_rms`` to
    :class:`EnergyBargeInWatcher` (see docstring there).

class EnergyBargeInWatcher:
    """Monitors an audio stream for sustained speech energy while TTS
    is playing, triggering the controller when the user actually
    barges in (not when the bot's own audio leaks into the mic).

    Three layers of echo defence keep the watcher from
    self-triggering on TTS audio leaking into the mic:

    1. **Reference signal** (best). Pass ``tts_energy_provider`` — a
       callable that returns the *current* TTS output RMS observed by
       the player. The watcher requires
       ``mic_rms >= echo_suppression_ratio × tts_rms`` before counting
       a frame toward the sustained-speech timer. Wire it as e.g.
       ``tts_energy_provider=lambda: player.last_output_rms`` once
       :class:`InterruptiblePlayer` exposes that.
    2. **Echo-floor calibration**. During the first
       ``echo_floor_window_ms`` (default 200 ms) of each TTS segment,
       the watcher observes the mic energy and uses the peak as an
       additional threshold for the rest of that segment. Assumes the
       user isn't talking yet during the bot's first ~200 ms.
    3. **Release refractory**. For ``tts_release_ms`` after TTS stops
       playing the watcher ignores mic input — that window covers
       echo tail / room reverb / AEC settle time.

    The static ``energy_threshold`` is a hard floor. With echo
    mitigations active you can leave it low (~0.012 = -38 dBFS) and
    still get robust triggers even on quiet speech.

    Usage::

        watcher = EnergyBargeInWatcher(
            ic,
            is_tts_playing=player.is_playing,
            tts_energy_provider=lambda: player.last_output_rms,
        )
        threading.Thread(target=watcher.run, args=(mic_stream,), daemon=True).start()

    ``mic_stream`` yields float32 numpy arrays at 16 kHz.
