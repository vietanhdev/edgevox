"""Higher-level workflow recipes assembled from the primitives.

The primitives in :mod:`edgevox.agents.workflow` -- ``Sequence``,
``Fallback``, ``Loop``, ``Parallel``, ``Router``, ``Supervisor``,
``Orchestrator``, ``Retry``, ``Timeout`` -- compose into named patterns
that recur across agentic projects. This module names a few of those
patterns and ships them as one-line factories so the boilerplate
("instantiate three LLMAgents with the right instructions, wrap in a
Sequence, return") doesn't have to be re-derived on every project.

Currently shipped:

- :class:`PlanExecuteEvaluate` -- Anthropic's three-agent harness
  pattern. Planner expands the user request into a plan + pass
  criterion, executor runs the plan via tools, evaluator checks the
  executor's report against the criterion. The evaluator is a
  *separate* agent on purpose: agents asked to evaluate their own
  work consistently over-rate it.

Future recipes (not yet shipped):

- ``PlanThenLoop`` -- planner + executor wrapped in a Loop until a
  goal predicate fires (combines the planner-executor decomposition
  with sensor-grounded retry).
- ``RetryWithBackoff`` -- ``Retry`` with exponential delay and
  jittered sleep between attempts.
- ``ParallelWithReducer`` -- ``Parallel`` plus a combine function so
  the caller doesn't have to walk per-agent replies by hand.

    The single-shot :class:`PlanExecuteEvaluate` recipe is structurally
    correct -- the evaluator is separate from the executor -- but it
    can still emit a wrong PASS when the underlying model is small
    (the failure mode Anthropic's article explicitly names). Picking
    a stronger model for the evaluator is one fix; the orthogonal fix
    that this recipe ships is to **loop** the recipe and verify
    against an external predicate, so a wrong PASS doesn't terminate
    the run.

    Usage::

        recipe = PlanThenLoop.build(
            planner_llm=planner_llm,
            executor_llm=executor_llm,

    Two predicates short-circuit the loop:

    1. ``world_predicate(): -> bool`` -- caller-supplied. Reads
       external ground truth (sim state, sensor reading, file
       existence). When this returns ``True`` the loop exits with a
       PASS verdict regardless of what the LLM evaluator said.
    2. The evaluator's own ``VERDICT: PASS`` -- exits the loop
       optimistically, on the assumption that when the model + the
       world both agree, that's good enough.

    Failed attempts feed forward: the planner on iteration N+1
    receives the previous evaluator's reasoning as part of its task
    string, so a model that under-planned step 2 on iteration 1 has
    a shot at fixing it on iteration 2.

      inner LLM to decide.
    - LLM-per-step is 5-15x slower per step. For a 4-step pick-and-place
      that's the difference between 2 s and 60 s.
    - Each step is deterministic: the same args produce the same
      tool/skill call.

    The returned object is an ``Agent`` -- ``.run(task, ctx) ->
    AgentResult`` -- so it drops into ``AgentApp(agent=...)`` and
    composes with every workflow primitive.

   next turn. Use it to decide your next action.

TERMINATION (read carefully -- this is the only way to stop):

You stop ONLY when the user's task is GENUINELY done. To stop, emit
exactly this on the last line of your reply:

    TASK COMPLETE: <one-sentence summary>

Any reply that does NOT contain the literal string 'TASK COMPLETE'
will be treated as 'continue working' and you'll be asked to call
another tool. Do not emit 'TASK COMPLETE' until every step the user
asked for has actually been executed by calling a tool and you have
seen the tool's result confirming it.

If you genuinely don't know what to do next, call the most relevant
read-only tool (list_objects, get_pose, get_gripper_state, etc.) to
gather information, then continue.

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- "Here are the positions." -> not done; continue with next action.
- "I will now move the cube." -> describing isn't doing; CALL the
  move tool now, don't just plan it.
- Calling one tool then summarising -> usually wrong. The task isn't
  done after one call unless the user asked for one thing.
- Looping the same tool with the same args -> if it errored once,
  change strategy.

    Weak models often keep acting after the goal is already satisfied,

    agent's ``after_tool`` point, counts actions, and every ``every_n`` of
    them asks ``verifier(ctx)`` whether the task is finished. When it says
    yes, the turn ends with a reply carrying the ``TASK COMPLETE`` marker, so
    :class:`_ReActRunner`'s recheck loop accepts termination without another
    LLM round-trip.

    State lives in ``ctx.hook_state[id(self)]`` so two instances on the same
    context keep independent counters, per the harness rule.
