"""Agent <-> Qt bridge.

The EdgeVox ``LLMAgent`` runs blocking LLM + engine calls on a worker
thread; Qt's event loop runs on the main thread. This module owns the
hand-off: a ``RookBridge`` exposes Qt signals that the UI binds to, and
under the hood schedules ``agent.run`` on a :class:`QThreadPool` worker
while translating agent events back into ``Signal.emit`` calls.

All chess-specific hooks live exactly where they did before
(:mod:`edgevox.examples.agents.chess_robot`). We reuse:

- :class:`MoveInterceptHook` — deterministic move application so the
  LLM can't freeze the board with a missed tool call.
- :class:`RichChessAnalyticsHook` — hidden system-role briefing with
  perspective, eval, opening, threats.
- :class:`RobotFaceHook` — emits robot_face events → translated to
  ``face_changed`` Qt signal here.
- :class:`MoveCommentaryHook` — captures last-move outcome for
  downstream reading.
- :class:`ThinkTagStripHook` / :class:`VoiceCleanupHook` /
  :class:`SentenceClipHook` — TTS sanitation before reply reaches the
  chat bubble.

The bridge deliberately does NOT launch an HTTP server. Everything runs
in one Python process: Qt UI ↔ bridge ↔ agent ↔ stockfish subprocess.
